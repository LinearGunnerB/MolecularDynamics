Project 1 on the mechanical properties of Nano Wires under compression
run.sh calls the most vital LAMMPS and Python scripts that generate data
files for visulization. Note that on my machine there were directories I
check are empty, if you run run.sh it may complain there is no directory
if so, you can make it in linux by typing: mkdir dirname. If something
does not work, please contact me and I will fix it! If you want help 
installing LAMMPS make sure to follow the tutorial on my blog at 
http://rocketurtlestars.co/home.html. Thanks :)
